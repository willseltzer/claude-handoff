description: Create a minimal handoff - just the essentials
---

Create a minimal `HANDOFF.md` with only the essentials. Use this for simple tasks or quick context transfers.

Output this exact format (fill in the brackets):

```markdown
# Handoff: [task in 5 words or less]

**Goal**: [one sentence]

**Done**: [comma-separated list of completed items, or "Nothing yet"]

**Next**: [the single most important next step]

**Watch out**: [one key warning, or "Nothing special"]
```

That's it. No extras. Save to `HANDOFF.md` or the path in `$ARGUMENTS`.
